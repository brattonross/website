						Vim motions are the best, and I want an editor with
						snappy performance. With plugins like Telescope and
						Mason, editing code, even in languages that I've never
						used before, is a great experience.

						I'm a fan of Lua, so having a terminal that uses it for
						configuration is comfortable. It also has a few
						interesting features like support for background images
						and multiplexing that I am yet to play around with.

						Seems like a popular choice, comes by default on MacOS

						My first foray into tiling window managers. It suits me
						well, but I do have issues with screen tearing. I'm
						toying with the idea of switching to Sway.

						I like to feel like I'm in nature when I'm coding. The
						coffee-stained text colour is comfortable on the eyes.
						My keyboard and deskmat usually use a plant-based theme,
						so I feel like this colour theme fits me well.

						Pop lured me in with its Nvidia compatibility. I like to

						Ergonomic, split board. I'm trying to look after my
						physical health a little more recently, so I felt that
						this board would be a decent investment. It is also
